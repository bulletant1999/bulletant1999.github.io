  <p>Hey, my name is Anthony, and I love to play videogames! I also really like to travel and ski and find it super exciting anytime I get a chance to travel somewhere different in the world even if it's still traveling within the United States. I grew up in Boca Raton Florida and moved here to Fort Myers going to FGCU and I'm currently going towards a bachelor in Software Engineering.<br /> <br /> </p>
