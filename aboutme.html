  <p>Hey, my name is Anthony, and I love to play videogames! I also really like to travel and ski and find it super exciting anytime I get a chance to travel somewhere different in the world even if it's still traveling within the United States<br /> <br />

  	Family, Country, Bears, <br /> <br />
